	<p> <strong>A statistic reveals that around 19
		Indians are killed daily due to drunk-driving road accidents (source)

		As per the current law, the blood alcohol limit permissible for
		driving is up to 0.03%, which is equivalent to 30 mg of alcohol per
		100 ml of blood. If an individual fails to pass this BAC test, he/she
		can be fined between Rs.2000 and Rs.10000, based on the final blood
		alcohol limit. Moreover, such individuals may also be sentenced to a
		prison term ranging between 7 months and four years.</strong>></p>
